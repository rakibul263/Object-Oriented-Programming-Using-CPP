## Concepts Covered 🌐

### Classes & Objects 🏫

- Learn the blueprint of creating objects.
- Detailed examples of class and object creation, usage, and manipulation.

### Constructor 🛠️

- Explore constructors, their types, and usage.
- Examples demonstrating parameterized constructors, default constructors, and copy constructors.

### Destructor 💣

- Understand the role of destructors in resource management.
- Examples showcasing when and how destructors are used.

### Abstraction 🎭

- Understand how to hide complex implementation details and show only the necessary features.
- Examples and explanations on how to achieve abstraction in C++.

### Encapsulation 🛡️

- Learn how to bundle the data and methods that operate on the data within one unit.
- Examples illustrating how to protect data from unauthorized access.

### Inheritance 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

- Dive into different types of inheritance and their usage.
- Examples demonstrating single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance.

### Polymorphism 🎭

- Understand the concept of polymorphism and its types.
- Examples of compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding) polymorphism.

### Shallow & Deep Copy 📝

- Learn the difference between shallow and deep copying of objects.
- Examples demonstrating how to implement deep copy constructors.

### Static Keyword ⚡

- Understand the use of the static keyword in classes.
- Examples showing static data members and static member functions.
